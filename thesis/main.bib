	abstract = {The Measurement Instrumentation and Sensors Handbook describes the use of instruments and techniques for practical measurements required in engineering, physics, chemistry, and the life sciences.The book examines:SensorsHardwareSoftwareTechniquesInformation processing systemsAutomatic data acquisitionReduction and analysis as well as their incorporation for control purposesOrganized according to the measurement problem, each section addresses the different ways of making a measurement for a given variable. Chapters present information on three levels:Basic information without equations and a description of the subject that can be understood by the newcomerDetailed text and mathematical treatment essential for discovering applications and solving problems outside one's field of specialtyAdvanced applications of the subject, evaluative opinions, and areas for future studyThe Measurement, Instrumentation and Sensors Handbook provides a graded level of difficulty from start to finish, serving the reference needs of the broadest group of readers. Edited by one of the more noted instrumentation experts in the world, the book contains nearly 150 contributions, covering all aspects on the design and implementation of various instrumentation.2 Vol set has been combined into one book},
